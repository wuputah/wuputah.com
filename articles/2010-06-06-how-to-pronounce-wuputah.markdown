title: How to pronounce "wuputah"
date: 06/06/2010

Here's the problem with posting this in text: ˈwoŏpətä. You all know [IPA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet), right? Me neither.~

Let me try to break it down:

* The first syllable, woŏp, is like _whoops_, but it shouldn't rhyme with _hoops_.
* The second syllable, ə, is a very common vowel sound in English, and is pronounced like _uhh_ as in _cup_. I also sometime pronounce this syllable as ɛ, which is closer to _ehh_, as in _bed_.
* The third syllable, tä, is pronounced as in the first syllable in _ta-ta!_

Emphasis is on the first syllable, so it's _WHOOP-uh-ta_.

You're doing it wrong if:

* You pronounce _utah_, as in the state.
* The first syllable doesn't include the _p_, and hence sounds like _woo-poo-tah_.
